                <h3>Let me tell you a little about myself...</h3>
                <p>I'm a career educator with a growing passion for information technologies and computer science. I love cafes, exploring nature, and good stories in all mediums. But these days, my main hobby is studying. I'm having a great time working on small projects to build my skills and knowledge.</p>
                <p>I have built a number full-stack web applications with Python backends utilising frameworks like Flask and Django connected to SQLite and Postgres DB's. On the front end I've built fully responsive single-page apps utilising REACT.js, styled with CSS and SCSS. And I'm actively doing more!</p>
